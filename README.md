# STM32CubeH7 MCU Firmware Package

![latest tag](https://img.shields.io/github/v/tag/STMicroelectronics/STM32CubeH7.svg?color=brightgreen)

**STM32Cube** is an STMicroelectronics original initiative to ease developers' life by reducing efforts, time and cost.

**STM32Cube** covers the overall STM32 products portfolio. It includes a comprehensive embedded software platform delivered for each STM32 series.
   * The CMSIS modules (core and device) corresponding to the ARM(tm) core implemented in this STM32 product.
   * The STM32 HAL-LL drivers, an abstraction layer offering a set of APIs ensuring maximized portability across the STM32 portfolio.
   * The BSP drivers of each evaluation, demonstration or nucleo board provided for this STM32 series.
   * A consistent set of middleware libraries such as RTOS, USB, FatFS, graphics, touch sensing library...
   * A full set of software projects (basic examples, applications, and demonstrations) for each board provided for this STM32 series.

The **STM32CubeH7 MCU Package** projects are directly running on the STM32H7 series boards. You can find in each Projects/*Board name* directories a set of software projects (Applications/Demonstration/Examples).

## Some middleware libraries are unavailable in this repository

In this repository, the middleware libraries listed below **along with** the projects (demos, applications, and examples) using them, are **not available** as they (the middleware libraries) are subject to some restrictive license terms requiring the user's approval via a "click thu" procedure.
* `./Middlewares/ST/STM32_Audio`
* `./Middlewares/ST/STemWin`
* `./Middlewares/ST/TouchGFX`

If needed, they can be found inside the full firmware package available on our website `st.com` and downloadable from [here](https://www.st.com/content/st_com/en/products/embedded-software/mcu-mpu-embedded-software/stm32-embedded-software/stm32cube-mcu-mpu-packages/stm32cubeh7.html#get-software).
